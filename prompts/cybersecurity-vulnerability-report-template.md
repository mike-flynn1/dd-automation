Create a Cybersecurity Vulnerability Report in HTML format with the following information:

A logo in the header should be at the top of the page, this logo should be center-aligned and use the image at /templates/static/bamtech-logo.png

The title at the top of the page is center-aligned and should say "Cybersecurity Vulnerability Report"

A subtitle under the title should include todays date in the following format: Month Day, Year (example: October 29, 2025)

The first section under the date should be labeled "Introduction" and contain the following text, which should not be altered: "The following information is a comprehensive overview of the Cybersecurity posture for SBIR DTK and OnePASS."

The second section after the introduction should be titled "Vulnerabilities". This section will contain a table with the following information:

- Total Unmitigated CAT I findings (both High and Critical)
- Unmitigated CAT I findings (High and Critical) over the course of the last 30 days only
- Total Unmitigated CAT II findings (Medium and Moderate severity)
- Unmitigated CAT II findings (Medium and Moderate severity) over the course of the last 180 days only
- Total Raw CAT III findings (Low severity)

The next section under the table should be titled "Remediation Process" and contain the following text which should not be altered: "All open High and Medium items are evaluated to ensure they are true findings. Once they are identified as valid issues, they are prioritized in the scrum team’s product backlog according to severity. Any items that cannot be fixed within the given SLA timeframe will be clearly communicated with the government and PO&AM’d." The last sentence in this paragraph should contain the following text: "All findings open longer than 30 days will be carried over to quarterly Information Security POA&M."

The next section after "Remediation Process" should be called "Monthly Asset Discovery Results" and contain a count of the overall repositories. This will show the total amount of repositories, and it should show the delta from the last 30 days. If there are 100 repositories and 3 were added in the last month, it should state "100 total repositories with N added in the last 30 days."

The next section should be titled "Point of Contact" and should contain the following text that should not be altered: "BAM Technologies is the official point of contact for resolving application vulnerabilities. Any vulnerabilities that result from A1 VDC-owned infrastructure must be resolved by the managed service provider."

The final section should be called "Resource Update" and should contain the following information that should not be altered: "There are no purchase requirements and no manpower shifts required at this time."
